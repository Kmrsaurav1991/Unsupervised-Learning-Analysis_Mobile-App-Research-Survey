# Unsupervised-Learning-Analysis_Mobile-App-Research-Survey

The dataset represents the download behavior and other information of the consumer app. Demographic and psychometric information for each consumer were collected from the survey for analysis to help marketing departments to segment users. Our roadmap in this task is the following: a) Reduce the number of variables: The original dataset have over 40 columns, which make difficult to interpret any conclusion. We focus in a psychometric view to do this. b) Make a segmentation based in the KNN-mean technique, with this we can associate observations in clusters which will be our target customer for a specifics strategies. c) Use demographics data to be even more precise in our recommendation. d) Make recommendations to the marketing team based in the cluster we have found.
