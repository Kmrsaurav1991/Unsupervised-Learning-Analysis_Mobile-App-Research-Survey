# Unsupervised-Learning-Analysis_Mobile-App-Research-Survey

The dataset represents the download behaviour and other information of the consumer app. Demographic and psychometric information for each consumer was collected from the survey for analysis to help marketing departments segment, users. Our roadmap in this task is the following: a) Reduce the number of variables: The original dataset have over 40 columns, which make it difficult to interpret any conclusion. We focus on a psychometric view to do this. b) Make a segmentation based in the KNN-mean technique, with this we can associate observations in clusters that will be our target customer for specific strategies. c) Use demographics data to be even more precise in our recommendation. d) Make recommendations to the marketing team based on the cluster we have found.
